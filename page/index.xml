      <description>Hello there. Welcome. I find it strange that you are reading this. What does that say about you? What does that say about me? I am just a lowly data scientist who put this site together to disseminate materials to students who hope to learn something about data science from me. There is no other reason for you to be here, reading this.
But you are here. And that says something.</description>

      <description>I enjoy teaching, mostly about statistics, predictive modeling, and anything having to do with R. I aim to teach from a more practical standpoint, mainly because I am not a theoretical mathematician/statistician. There is nothing wrong with being theoretical, I am just not smart enough for it.
Materials related to courses I teach can be found below. Enjoy.</description>
