      <description>I certainly don’t want to promise that I’ll post anything here. My past experiences have proven that maintaining a blog is serious business. However, I’m gonna leave this section here, just in case I change my mind.</description>

      <description>Hello there. Welcome. I find it strange that you are here, reading this. What does it say about you that you are? What does it say about me that I even wrote this in the first place?
I am just a lowly data scientist who put this site together to provide materials to students who hope to learn something about data science from me. There is no other reason for you to be here, reading this.</description>

      <description> I enjoy teaching, mostly about statistics, predictive modeling, and anything having to do with R. I aim to teach from a more practical standpoint, mainly because I am not a theoretical mathematician/statistician. There is nothing wrong with being theoretical, I am just not smart enough for it.
Materials related to courses I teach can be found below. Enjoy at your own risk.

      <description>Introduction to Data Science Syllabus Course Materials Installing R and RStudio You will need both R and RStudio for this course. R is a statistical computing and graphic programming language, and RStudio is the IDE for R that we will be using. Installing these on your laptop before our first meeting will help us move along at a quicker pace.
To install R, follow the instructions for your OS here: https://cran.</description>
