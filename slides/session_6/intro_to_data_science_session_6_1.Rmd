### How and why do they do it?

- Sometimes for machines (predictive accuracy), sometimes for humans (to understand and take action)

- Ethically

- With lots of different tools
  + Data storage: SQL, Hive, Hadoop, NoSQL, flat files, etc.
  + Computing: R, Python, Matlab, SAS, Scala, Spark, laptops, servers, cloud, etc.
  + Reporting: Tableau, Powerpoint, Word, Excel, etc.
  + Deploying: platforms, developers, etc.

- In a reproducible way
  + using version control (git, svn)
  + clean and commented code that actually runs!
  + R/Jupyter Notebooks, R Markdown, and many other tools for reporting and technical documentation
